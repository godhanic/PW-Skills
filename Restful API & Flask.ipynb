What is a RESTful API?\n","   * A RESTful API follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles.\n","   It uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n","   Resources are identified by URLs.\n","   Data is typically exchanged in JSON or XML.\n","   It’s widely used due to simplicity and scalability.\n","\n","2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n","   * An API specification defines how an API should behave.\n","   It describes endpoints, request/response formats, parameters, and authentication.\n","   It acts as a blueprint for developers.\n","   Helps ensure consistency and understanding across teams.\n","   Examples: OpenAPI/Swagger, RAML.\n","\n","3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n","   * Flask is a lightweight Python web framework.\n","   It is popular for APIs due to simplicity and flexibility.\n","   It has minimal boilerplate code.\n","   Supports extensions like Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-RESTful.\n","   Great for rapid prototyping and small-to-medium apps.\n","\n","4. What is routing in Flask?\n","   * Routing maps a URL path to a function.\n","   In Flask, routes are defined using @app.route().\n","   It determines what happens when a user visits a URL.\n","   Each route corresponds to an endpoint.\n","   It is the core of handling web/API requests.\n","\n","5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n","   * Install Flask (pip install flask).\n","   Import Flask and create an app object.\n","   Define a route using @app.route(\"/\").\n","   Write a function returning a response.\n","   Run app with app.run().\n","\n","6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n","* Common methods:\n","\n","  * GET → Retrieve data\n","  * POST → Create new data\n","  * PUT/PATCH → Update data\n","  * DELETE → Remove data\n","\n","  These define the action on resources.\n","\n","7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n","   * It defines a URL route for the application.\n","   Connects URLs to functions.\n","   Handles incoming requests to that URL.\n","   Supports specifying methods (methods=\\['GET','POST']).\n","   It’s the main way to register endpoints.\n","\n","8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n","   * GET → Requests data, parameters in URL, safe & idempotent.\n","   POST → Sends data to server, parameters in body, modifies state.\n","   GET is mainly for retrieving.\n","   POST is for creating/submitting.\n","   GET is cacheable, POST is not.\n","\n","9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n","   * Use error handlers (@app.errorhandler).\n","   Return custom JSON responses with status codes.\n","   Handle common errors (404, 500, 400).\n","   Can log errors for debugging.\n","   Use abort() to stop requests with errors.\n","\n","10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n","    * Install SQLAlchemy (pip install flask\\_sqlalchemy).\n","    Configure database URI in app config.\n","    Initialize SQLAlchemy(app).\n","    Define models as Python classes.\n","    Use ORM methods to query/insert/update data.\n","\n","11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n","    * It’s a Flask extension for database management.\n","    Provides ORM (Object Relational Mapping).\n","    Simplifies SQL operations via Python classes.\n","    Supports multiple databases (SQLite, MySQL, etc.).\n","    Helps avoid writing raw SQL.\n","\n","12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n","    * Blueprints allow modular app structure.\n","    They group routes, views, and logic.\n","    Useful for large apps or APIs.\n","    Encourage reusability and maintainability.\n","    They’re like mini-apps inside Flask.\n","\n","13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n","    * It represents the current HTTP request.\n","    Provides access to form data, query params, headers, and JSON.\n","    Used to read client input.\n","    Example: request.args, request.json.\n","    It’s central for handling API input.\n","\n","14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n","    * Define a route with @app.route().\n","    Specify HTTP methods (methods=\\['GET','POST']).\n","    Inside the function, process input with request.\n","    Return response using jsonify().\n","    Example: /api/users\n","\n","15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n","    * Converts Python objects (dicts, lists) to JSON response.\n","    Automatically sets Content-Type: application/json.\n","    Simplifies response formatting.\n","    Ensures proper JSON encoding.\n","    Widely used in REST APIs.\n","\n","16. Explain Flask’s url\\_for() function.\n","    * Generates URLs dynamically for routes.\n","    Takes route function name as argument.\n","    Prevents hardcoding URLs.\n","    Example: url\\_for('home') → /home.\n","    Useful for redirects and templates.\n","\n","17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n","    * By default, Flask serves static files from the /static folder.\n","    Access via /static/filename.\n","    No need to configure manually.\n","    Used for CSS, JS, images.\n","    Custom static folder path can be set.\n","\n","18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n","    * It defines the contract of the API.\n","    Describes endpoints, inputs, outputs, and errors.\n","    Ensures developers know how to use the API.\n","    Prevents miscommunication across teams.\n","    Examples: Swagger/OpenAPI docs.\n","\n","19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n","    * They indicate the result of a request.\n","    Examples: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found).\n","    Helps clients understand success/failure.\n","    Provides standard error handling.\n","    Improves API usability.\n","\n","20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n","    * Use methods=\\['POST'] in @app.route().\n","    Access data via request.form or request.json.\n","    Validate the input.\n","    Process and save data (e.g., DB).\n","    Return a JSON response with status code.\n","\n","21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n","    * Use authentication/authorization (JWT, OAuth).\n","    Enable HTTPS (SSL).\n","    Validate and sanitize inputs.\n","    Rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n","    Use Flask extensions for security.\n","\n","22.
