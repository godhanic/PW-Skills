What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n","* Compiled languages translate source code into machine code before execution, creating an executable. Interpreted languages run code line-by-line at runtime. Compiled languages run faster but need compilation beforehand, while interpreted ones are easier to debug. Python is mostly interpreted but compiles to bytecode first.\n","\n","2. What is exception handling in Python?\n","* Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to manage runtime errors gracefully. It uses try, except, else, and finally blocks. This prevents abrupt program termination. It allows developers to respond to errors in a controlled way.\n","\n","3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n","* The finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs. It’s often used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources. Code inside finally runs after try and except blocks. It ensures necessary final steps are executed.\n","\n","4. What is logging in Python?\n","* Logging in Python records events during program execution. It’s useful for debugging and tracking application behavior. The logging module supports different severity levels. Logs can be sent to files, consoles, or other destinations.\n","\n","5. What is the significance of the **del** method in Python?\n","* The **del** method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s used for cleanup before memory release. It runs automatically when an object is no longer referenced. It should be used cautiously as timing is uncertain.\n","\n","6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n","* import brings in an entire module, requiring module\\_name.function format to access elements. from ... import imports specific items directly into the current namespace. This allows direct use without module prefix. Both help reuse code but differ in scope control.\n","\n","7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n","* Multiple exceptions can be handled using multiple except blocks. They can also be grouped in a tuple within a single except. This prevents code duplication when handling similar errors. The approach depends on the situation.\n","\n","8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n","* The with statement in file handling ensures proper resource management. It automatically closes the file after the block finishes, even if an error occurs. It reduces the need for explicit close() calls. It makes code cleaner and safer.\n","\n","9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n","* Multithreading runs multiple threads in the same process, sharing memory. Multiprocessing runs separate processes, each with its own memory space. Multiprocessing avoids the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python. Multithreading is better for I/O-bound tasks, multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.\n","\n","10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n","* Logging provides a record of program execution for debugging and monitoring. It allows configurable message levels and formats. Logs can be stored persistently for analysis. It helps diagnose issues in production environments.\n","\n","11. What is memory management in Python?\n","* Memory management in Python involves allocation and deallocation of memory. Python uses a private heap space for objects. The garbage collector reclaims unused memory. It combines reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n","\n","12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n","* The basic steps in exception handling are: wrap risky code in a try block, handle errors in except blocks, optionally use else for success paths, and finally for cleanup. This ensures code runs smoothly. It prevents crashes from unexpected issues.\n","\n","13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n","* Memory management is important to avoid leaks and inefficiency. Poor memory control can slow programs and exhaust resources. Automatic garbage collection helps but isn’t foolproof. Developers should manage large objects and references carefully.\n","\n","14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n","* try contains code that may cause an error. except catches and handles the error if it occurs. Together, they prevent abrupt program termination. They form the core of Python’s exception handling mechanism.\n","\n","15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n","* Python’s garbage collection reclaims memory from unused objects. It uses reference counting to track object usage. For cyclic references, it uses a cyclic garbage collector. It runs automatically but can be triggered manually.\n","\n","16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n","* The else block in exception handling runs only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It’s used for code that should execute only when everything went smoothly. It helps separate success logic from error handling.\n","\n","17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n","* Common logging levels in Python are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. DEBUG is for detailed information, INFO for general events. WARNING flags potential issues, ERROR shows serious problems, and CRITICAL marks severe failures.\n","\n","18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n","* os.fork() creates a new process by duplicating the current one, available on Unix-like systems. multiprocessing is a cross-platform module for process-based parallelism. multiprocessing offers more features and better portability. os.fork() is low-level and less flexible.\n","\n","19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n","* Closing a file frees up system resources and ensures data is written to disk. Not closing can cause data loss or corruption. with statements handle this automatically. It’s a best practice in file handling.\n","\n","20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n","* file.read() reads the entire file content as a single string. file.readline() reads one line at a time. read() is good for small files, readline() for line-by-line processing. They suit different use cases.\n","\n","21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n","* The logging module records events for tracking and debugging. It supports multiple severity levels and output formats. Logs can be directed to various destinations. It helps maintain program reliability.\n","\n","22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n","* The os module helps interact with the operating system for file handling. It allows creating, deleting, and navigating files and directories. It also handles paths and permissions. It’s essential for file-related automation.\n","\n","23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n","* Challenges in memory management include handling circular references, large data objects, and performance overhead. Python’s garbage collector handles most cases but not all. Developers must still write memory-efficient code.\n","\n","24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n","* You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. For example, raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\"). This is useful for enforcing rules. It lets you signal errors intentionally.\n","\n","25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n","* Multithreading is important in I/O-bound applications where tasks wait for external resources. It allows multiple tasks to progress concurrently. It improves responsiveness in programs like servers or GUIs. It doesn’t speed up CPU-heavy tasks in Python due to the GIL.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"0_vH_LjKUVAN"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LibQDSMtEhZL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"JThOqweQFZpd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical Python OOPs questions\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Cxp7g0BoR6y_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# 1.
